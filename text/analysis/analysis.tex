In this chapter we recall the dynamics of the system whose weights have already been shaped by a previous learning experience. We will describe the system as a network of identical oscillators coupled via their nonlinear output. Then, via bifurcation analysis, we will characterise the qualitative behaviour of a simple 4-dimensional oscillator, with respect to the parameters that characterise the dynamics of the system. In the final section we study under which condition on the graph connectivity synchronization occurs.
