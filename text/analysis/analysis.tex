In this chapter we recall the dynamics of the system whose weights have already been shaped by a previous learning experience. We will describe the system as a network of oscillators coupled via their nonlinear output. 
Using Lyapunov Analysis, for a complete, homogeneous network of $N$ nodes, sufficient conditions for the synchronisation of the oscillators are provided. Then, for the simple case of 4-dimensional oscillator, we will characterise the behaviour of  the network on the synchronisation manifold, with respect to the parameters that characterise the dynamics of the system.
